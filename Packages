Package: com.isteveo.stocker13
Name: Stocker13
Version: 0.8-beta

Description: Simple & mostly stock looking.
 Some production icons are ugly, don’t fit the color pallet, or just don’t sit well within the general symmetry of the iOS home screen.
 I aim to fix this with Stocker13!

Package: com.isteveo.pushmod64
Section: System
Maintainer: iSteve-O <isteveo.ipa@gmail.com>
Architecture: iphoneos-arm
Version: 1.3
Pre-Depends: firmware (>=11.0)
Name: PushMod64 (iOS 11+)
Author: iSteve-O <isteveo.ipa@gmail.com>
Description: 3, 5, & 10m email fetch intervals!
 PushMod64 gives you the additional options of choosing 3, 5 & 10 minute email fetch intervals, in addition to the stock iOS settings of 15, 30 & 60 minutes.
 The tweak uses minimal battery, even on the 3 minute setting, which basically turns POP/IMAP email accounts into push, for all (most) intents & purposes!
 If you are on iOS 10 or lower, please install the original PushMod instead, as I cannot promise this will work for you.
 This tweak was made specifically for iPhone X on iOS 13.3, but should work on all versions from iOS 11.0 through current (iOS 13.3).
 I have attempted to localize this tweak for all languages supported by iOS. If I made any mistakes in your language, please tell me what should be fixed, especially my Arabic & Swedish friends. I did my best, and I did it manually.  
 I am not responsible for any issues with iOS versions under 13, but this package does fully backup upon install & fully replace the stock files upon removal, so it should be fine.
 If you have any issues just remove it.
